Big O Notation

Objectives 
- Motivate the need for something like Big o Notation
- Describe what Big O Notation is
- Simplify Big O Expressions
- Define "time complexity" and "space complexity"
- Evaluate the time complexity and space complexity
- Describe what a logarithm is


What is the idea? 
Imagine we have multiple implementations of the same function. How can we determine which one is the "best" ?

Eg. "Write a function that accepts a string input and returns a reversed copy"

Who Cares ?
It's important to have a precise vobabulary to talk about how our code performs
Useful for duscussing trade-offs between different approaches
When your code slows down or crashes, identifying parts of the code that are inefficient can help us find pain points in our applications
Less important: it comes up in intervies!
